# Green Dense City - Visualization Tool

An interactive visualization tool for exploring how urban design, buildings, and green spaces contribute to healthy and sustainable city environments.

## About the Project

Green Dense City is a research initiative funded by Formas, aimed at increasing public understanding of how buildings and green spaces can be used to create healthy, green living environments in densified urban areas.

The project addresses critical questions about urban development:
- How can we design dense cities that remain healthy and sustainable?
- What role do green spaces play in urban quality of life?
- How do building design choices affect air quality and climate?

This visualization tool combines research data from the CityAirSim project with educational materials to help users explore the relationships between urban design choices and environmental outcomes.
